### 4. Populating More Data for Robust Testing
To thoroughly test the search functionality, two additional tasks were added to the dashboard.

### 5. Global Search by Owner
The search bar successfully filters the grid in real-time, showing only the tasks matching the owner name "M NAVANEETH".

### 6. Global Search by ID
The search functionality is confirmed to work across multiple fields, here showing the specific task matching the ID "cloud-deploy-02".

### 7. Task Execution and History
This screenshot demonstrates a successful task execution. The accordion panel for the executed task is expanded, showing the captured output, while the other task with no execution shows no history.

### 8. Safe Delete Operation
To prevent accidental data loss, a confirmation modal appears when a user initiates a delete action.

### 9. Verifying Task Deletion
After confirming the deletion, the dashboard updates, and the task with ID "echo-01" is successfully removed, confirming the end-to-end delete functionality.
